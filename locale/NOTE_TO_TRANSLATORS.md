Review Quality Collector (RQC), the system to which this plugin provides an interface,
is (and will continue to be) available in English only.

All parties using this plugin (editors, reviewers, indirectly also authors)
will receive emails from RQC that are formulated in English.

It is therefore presumably not useful to provide translations
in other languages for this plugin:
Journals that cater to non-English-speaking audiences
will simply not use the plugin at all.
